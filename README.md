# Feature Forge üî•ü§ñ

**Unleash your app's potential with AI-powered feature suggestions!**

Feature Forge is a Next.js web application that helps developers and product thinkers quickly generate a list of relevant and innovative features for their web or mobile app ideas. Simply describe your application, and our AI, powered by Google's Gemini model via Genkit, will provide a structured list of feature suggestions, complete with descriptions, categories, and estimated complexity.

    *   **Name:** A concise title for the feature.
    *   **Description:** A 1-2 sentence explanation of what the feature entails and its benefits.
    *   **Category:** Helps organize features (e.g., "Core Functionality," "User Interface," "AI-Powered").
    *   **Complexity:** An estimated implementation effort (Low, Medium, High).
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Sleek UI:** Utilizes ShadCN UI components for a clean and professional user interface.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Easy to Use:** Simple and intuitive interface for quick feature generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    *   [React](https://reactjs.org/) (v18+)
    *   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    *   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    *   [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (for UI components)
    *   [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) (for icons)
*   **Backend & AI:**

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/feature-forge.git 
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
    cd feature-forge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env # If you create an .env.example
    ```
    You'll need to add your Google AI API key to this file. Genkit uses the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable by default.
    ```env
    # .env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```
    You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts both the Next.js frontend and the Genkit development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The Next.js app will typically run on `http://localhost:9002` and the Genkit development UI (if you explore it) on `http://localhost:4000`.

5.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:9002` in your web browser.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Navigate** to the Feature Forge application in your browser.
2.  You'll see a **text area** labeled "Describe your web or mobile app idea...".
3.  **Enter a clear and concise description** of the application you're envisioning. The more detail you provide about the core purpose and target audience, the better the feature suggestions will be.
    *   *Example:* "A mobile app for urban gardeners to identify plants, track their garden's progress, and get AI-driven advice on plant care and pest control."
4.  Click the **"Generate Features"** button.
5.  The AI will process your request, and a list of **suggested features** will appear below the form. Each feature will be displayed on a card showing its name, description, category, and estimated complexity.

## üå± Potential Future Enhancements

*   **Image Input:** Allow users to upload a sketch or mockup image along with the description.
*   **User Accounts:** Save generated feature lists for users.
*   **Export Options:** Allow users to export features (e.g., CSV, JSON).
*   **Advanced Customization:** More options to guide the AI's suggestions (e.g., target platform, specific technologies to include/exclude).
*   **Voting/Prioritization:** Allow users to vote on or prioritize generated features.
*   **Genkit Tool Integration:** Add Genkit tools to fetch examples of similar apps or common UI patterns for suggested features.
